# Intermittent Expo CLI Installation or Build Failures

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the Expo CLI: intermittent installation failures or build errors.  These issues often stem from dependency conflicts, incorrect project configurations, or caching problems within the Expo CLI itself.

The `bug.js` file represents a seemingly simple Expo app, but it might fail to build or install correctly under certain circumstances, highlighting the problem.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides potential solutions and workarounds, including dependency cleanup, cache clearing, and ensuring your Expo and React Native versions are compatible.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Try running `expo start`.
4. Observe if the project starts correctly or encounters any errors.  Repeat this a few times to observe intermittent behavior.

## Troubleshooting and Solutions

The solutions are outlined in `bugSolution.js` but may involve:

* **Cleaning npm or yarn cache:** `npm cache clean --force` or `yarn cache clean`
* **Removing and reinstalling dependencies:** `expo prebuild` followed by `expo install`
* **Updating Expo CLI:** `npm install -g expo-cli`
* **Checking compatibility:** Ensure the React Native and Expo versions in your project are compatible with each other.
* **Inspecting the error messages:** Carefully examine any error messages from the Expo CLI and npm/yarn for clues on the specific cause.
